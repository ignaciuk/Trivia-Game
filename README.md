# Trivia-Game

##What the project does
This project served as a test case for a lot of the JavaScript logic and jQuery usage I had recently learned. 

##Why the project is useful
The project helped me clarify a lot of the syntax for writing in JavaSCript and made using jQuery more habitual.

##Who maintains and contributes to the project
Hmm. Pretty sure this is just me.
